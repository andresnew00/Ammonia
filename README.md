Project 1 

Best Prices in Town

Andres, Matt Crowe, Alexander

	For our first project we want to make a web application that will allow the user to search for the best gas prices within a certain distance from a specific location. We will have a container that holds a map from Google Maps. There will be a search bar that the user can enter an address or location and the map will then display the surrounding gas stations and display which one has the cheapest gas prices. 
	We will be utilizing the Google Maps API to gather locations of gas stations and display them on a map. We will also be using the mygasfeed.com API to gather information about the gas prices specific locations. 

Tasks:

Andres: going to work on which information we are going
to gather from which API and how we are going to render 
it into our application.

Matt: algorithms which are going to GET from the API 
databases and where they will be displayed.

Alexander: mobile responsiveness and creating a clean front end display.
